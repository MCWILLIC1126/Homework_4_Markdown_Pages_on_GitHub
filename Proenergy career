## My Role at PROENERGY

At PROENERGY, I work in a fast-paced engineering environment where I support the design and improvement of turbine components, tooling, and reverse-engineered parts.  
My work combines **CAD modeling**, **engineering problem-solving**, and **manufacturing awareness**.

### Key areas I focus on include:

- **Parametric CAD modeling** in Creo and SolidWorks  
- **Reverse-engineering turbine hardware** such as LM2500 and LM6000 components  
- **Designing jigs, fixtures, and tooling** for machining and part marking  
- **Identifying issues in engineering drawings**—missing dimensions, GD&T errors, extreme tolerances, etc.  
- **Improving drawing standards** through automation, mapkeys, and checklists  
- **Applying GD&T and MBD principles** to ensure manufacturability and inspection clarity

## What I’m Currently Developing

I am actively working to elevate my skillset and impact at PROENERGY. Some ongoing development goals include:

1. **Becoming a top-tier parametric modeler**, able to produce clean, predictable, MBD-ready models  
2. **Expanding reverse-engineering workflows**, including Design X → Creo/SolidWorks geometry transfer  
3. **Building internal design tools**, such as:  
   - Automated drawing-checking macros  
   - Bolt-circle and stress calculators in Excel  
   - SolidWorks/Creo config and mapkey systems  
4. **Deepening technical knowledge** in turbine engines and engineering best practices

## Why I Enjoy This Work

I am driven by:

- Creating designs that solve real problems  
- Working independently with the freedom to think  
- Blending *hands-on manufacturing experience* with *engineering design*  
- Continuous learning in math, physics, and CAD  
- Helping raise the quality and efficiency of engineering deliverables  

My long-term vision includes becoming a leader in engineering design methodology and eventually teaching engineering at the university level.
