# About Me – PROENERGY Career

Hello! My name is **Cameron McWilliams**, and I am a *Mechanical Designer II* at **PROENERGY**.  
My work centers on turbine component design, reverse engineering, engineering drawings, and efficient CAD-based problem-solving.

## My Role at PROENERGY

I work in a hands-on, engineering-focused environment supporting the gas turbine industry—especially LM2500 and LM6000 systems. My position blends mechanical design, CAD modeling, engineering fundamentals, and manufacturing awareness.

### Key areas of responsibility include:

- **Parametric modeling** in Creo and SolidWorks  
- **Reverse-engineering turbine hardware** and converting mesh scans into usable 3D models  
- **Designing tooling, jigs, and fixtures** for machining, measuring, and part marking  
- **Evaluating and correcting engineering drawings**, including:  
  - Missing dimensions  
  - GD&T errors  
  - Unrealistic tolerances  
  - Annotation or layout issues  
- **Building drawing automation tools**, mapkeys, and configuration files  
- **Applying GD&T and MBD principles** to ensure design intent is clear and manufacturable

## What I’m Focusing on Improving

I am committed to continuous growth as a designer and engineer. My current areas of development include:

1. **Becoming an elite parametric modeler**, producing stable, clean, MBD-ready models  
2. **Enhancing reverse engineering workflows**, especially Design X → Creo/SolidWorks transitions  
3. **Building internal engineering tools**, such as:  
   - Automated drawing standards checklists  
   - Excel-based engineering calculators (bolt circle, flange design, stress areas, etc.)  
   - CAD mapkeys, macros, and modeling templates  
4. **Deepening turbine engine knowledge** to improve design intent and part function understanding

## Why This Work Matters to Me

- I love solving mechanical and geometric problems  
- I enjoy combining *hands-on experience* with high-level engineering design  
- I value the independence, creativity, and technical challenge of the role  
- I want to become a true expert in modeling, design theory, and engineering communication  
- This role supports my long-term goal of teaching engineering at the university level  

I take pride in producing work that is clean, accurate, and highly usable for machinists, engineers, inspectors, and manufacturing teams.
