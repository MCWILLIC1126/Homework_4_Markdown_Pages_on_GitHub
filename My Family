# About Me – My Family

Hello! My name is **Cameron McWilliams**, and everything I work toward in life is grounded in one priority above all others: *my family*.  
My wife and I are raising two wonderful daughters, and together we strive to build a home filled with love, growth, health, and meaningful memories.

## What We Value as a Family

We focus on building a home environment that supports our well-being and growth. Our shared values include:

- **Quality time** — Being intentional with evenings, weekends, and activities  
- **Health and wellness** — Whole-food meals, movement, sports, and family walks  
- **Learning and curiosity** — Encouraging schoolwork, reading, creativity, and exploration  
- **Traditions and memories** — Road trips, holidays, special meals, and everyday moments that matter  

These values help us stay connected and build a strong foundation for our daughters' future.

## How We Spend Time Together

We try to create routines and memories that bring us closer. Some of our favorite shared activities include:

1. **Sports & movement**  
   Basketball practice, volleyball games, gymnastics events, park time, and family walking goals.

2. **Creative hobbies**  
   Art projects, crafts, painting, and supporting each daughter’s creative interests.

3. **Cooking & meals**  
   Preparing healthy whole-food meals together and teaching our daughters good habits early.

4. **Evenings & weekends**  
   Movies, board games, study time, or simply talking about life and goals.

Family is my biggest source of motivation and the reason behind everything I strive to accomplish.
